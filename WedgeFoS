'''
This model basically computes the FActor of Safety of a wedge
based on the formulation of Low 1997.
This is an explicit formulation
Program developed by Rodrigo Hern√°ndez Carrillo

The program reads a vector, that includes the variables ordered as:

'''

import numpy as np
import itertools as it
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Function to compute the factor of safety

def FactorSafety (a1, b1): # Gw1, s, phi1, a2, b2, Gw2, phi2, c1, gamma)
    a=a1+b1
    return a

def aa1(c,d):
    return c+d

if __name__=="__main__":
    x=aa1(3,4)
    y=FactorSafety(x,3)
    print (y)
